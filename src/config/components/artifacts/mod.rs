    ///    for that platform and recommend its download accordingly.
    /// * **scripts**: if an artifact name contains "install" and ends with ".sh" or ".ps1"
    ///   we will assume it's an install script and generate an appropriate `curl | sh` for
    ///   it (`irm | iex` for ps1)

    ///   installer/bundle we will recommend its download at a higher priority, assuming
    ///   this is a very good way to install your app. This includes ".msi", ".app", ".dmg",
